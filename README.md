# Dash-cytosape implementation with psamm for the analysis of metabolic models

## This app explores the potential applications of network visualization for
## the visualization and analysis of genome scale metabolic models.

## By utilizing the Portable System for the Analysis of Metabolic Models
## (Steffensen et. at. 2016), we can use genomic information to reconstruct
## networks and analyze flux through metabolic systems.

#### Currently, this app utilizes a metbaolic model for Eubacterium rectale
#### as its based. the Biomass function is ere_biomass.
